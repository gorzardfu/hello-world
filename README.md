# hello-world
This is me using GitHub to learn more about coding.
I am on an internship and my want to know more about Python.
I may want to do this by learning about Neural Networks, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning through Michael Nielson's open source book, "Neural Networks and Deep Learning."
There may be other programming languages like C, C#, C++, R, SQL, Pearl, and others I may wish to mess around with.
